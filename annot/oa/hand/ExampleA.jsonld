      "rdf:value": "In the earliest recordings—Karl Böhm’s 1939 performance with the Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden, the Vienna Philharmonic’s 1946 studio rendition under Herbert von Karajan, and a 1950s recording with Wilhelm Furtwängler—both the Introduction and Coda are taken at noticeably brisker baseline tempi than in later decades. By contrast, the slowest Philharmonic introductions emerge in the interpretations of Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Herbert von Karajan from the mid-1980s onward, continuing into the 21st century, marking a distinct shift in pacing and expressive approach. A noteworthy exception to this trend is the 1995 recording of the Wiener Johann Strauss Orchestra under Willi Boskovsky. As longtime conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic’s New Year’s Concerts (1955–1979) and principal conductor of the historic Wiener Johann Strauss Orchester until his death, Boskovsky preserves a livelier, more traditionally Viennese tempo that aligns more closely with mid-century performance practice."
