      "rdf:value": "The most heavily grounded—or martial—passage in the composition appears in the B-section of Waltz No. 3. Beginning at bar 223, the melody is carried by a robust ensemble of trumpets, trombones, bassoons, and cellos, supported by rolling snare drums and emphatic contrabass half-notes on the downbeats. Meanwhile, the remainder of the orchestra articulates sharp upbeats on the second and third beats, while the first violins contribute a delicate eighth-note countermelody. In recordings such as those by the Vienna Philharmonic under Herbert von Karajan (1946) and Willi Boskovsky (1975), as well as the Staatskapelle Dresden with Karl Böhm (1939), the tempo remains brisk and precise. The percussion in these interpretations is particularly forceful, lending the section a distinctly militaristic character."
