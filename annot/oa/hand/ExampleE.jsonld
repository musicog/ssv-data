      "rdf:value": "Modifications in instrumentation by André Rieu’s ensemble significantly alter the character of the piece. Most notably, the inclusion of a piano—absent from Strauss’s original scoring—introduces a marked weightiness to the orchestral texture. This is particularly evident in passages where the piano initially doubles a delicate countermelody, undermining its filigree quality, and subsequently continues to reinforce the bass line. At times, it also doubles both wind and string parts, further thickening the sonority and diminishing the transparency of Strauss’s orchestration."
