While mid-20th-century orchestral practice typically placed concert A between 440 Hz and 444 Hz, reports suggest that the Philharmonic has tuned as high as 448 Hz when performing in the Musikverein.This trend becomes particularly evident when comparing recordings from 1946, 1975, 1991, and 2016, which together illustrate a perceptible upward shift."
